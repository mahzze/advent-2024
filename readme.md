### Advent of code attempt
This repo is an attempt at solving the challenges from [**advent of code, 2024 edition**](https://adventofcode.com/2024) using golang.
Do keep in mind that the input files are different for each person who attempts, so the answers in each file may only work for me, since the input files are restricted to the ones from my account. To get the correct answer on your own profile, substitute the input file of the desired challenge with the file of your own account.

### What is Advent of code?
A list of christmas-inspired programming challenges. The challenges are not all released at once, instead, two challenges are released per day, up until December 25, summing to a total of 50 puzzles. For more about this [click here](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about)

### Rules: 
- 1 challenge = 1 commit.
- Optimization = 1 commit.
- Each file has to deal with it's own challenge. Changing the file of the first challenge to make the second easier is not allowed.
